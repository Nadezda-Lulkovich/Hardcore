To really love a woman 
To understand her - 
You have got to know her deep inside 
Hear every thought - see every dream 

And give her wings - when she wants to fly 
Then when you find yourself 
Lying helpless in her arms
You know 
You really love a woman 

When you love a woman 
You tell her that she's really wanted 
When you love a woman 
You tell her that she's the one 

Because she needs somebody to tell her that 
It's going to last forever
So tell me have you ever really - 
Really really ever loved a woman?
